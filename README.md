# ***Tic-Tac-Toe (Python)***

## ***Overview:***

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python as the final project for the Python Essentials-I course(Cisco Networking Academy). The game is played between a user and the computer.

## ***Functionality:***

3×3 board displayed in the console
→ Implemented using nested lists and a custom display function with formatted printing

Player uses O, computer uses X
→ Managed through symbol assignment and conditional logic

User selects positions using numbers 1–9
→ Handled via user input, type conversion, and input validation

Computer chooses a random free position
→ Implemented using the random module and list of available cells

Game ends on win or draw
→ Controlled by loop conditions, win-check logic, and board-full detection

## ***Core Logic:***
Input validation prevents invalid or occupied moves

Winning conditions are checked for:

rows

columns

diagonals

Draw is detected when the board is full

## ***Outcome:***

This project applies Python fundamentals such as functions, loops, conditionals, lists, and basic logic to build a complete interactive game.
